# import replit

Let's build some excellent things on [repl.it](https://repl.it) with Python!


## `replit` Python Package

This repository is the home for the `replit` Python package, which provides:

- A fully-featured database client for [Repl.it DB](https://docs.repl.it/misc/database)
- A **work in progress** Repl.it user profile lookup.
- A Flask application decorator for ensuring Repl.it Auth required on specific routes.

Other helpful toys & utilities, like...

- A simple audio library that can play tones and audio files!
- Some helpful functions for displaying ANSI colors in interactive terminal sessions.
